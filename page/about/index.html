Website structure, contents and navigation are described in the blog article <a href=https://hexann666.github.io/recipe2pdf.github.io/posts/web_technologies/>Web Technologies</a></p><p>During the planning phase multiple decisions were made, concerning the project setup starting from more wide perspective: scrum setup, strategies for data preparation and analysis, as well as more practical decisions: libraries for data wrangling and tools, that will be used for development and deployment. Some proof of concept were made to ensure, that desired functionality can be implemented with selected tools. Also UX was thought through and a demo of UI was created.</p><p>The process flow of the goal application is represented on the flow diagram below from the user perspective.</p><p><img src=https://gitlab.web.fh-kufstein.ac.at/anna.fedorova/recipe2pdf/-/raw/main/diagrams+process_flows/user_journey.png alt=user_journey></p><p>This flow includes following user-system interactions: web scraping from a URL, provided by user in the UI; using NLP models to classify text and find the chunks, that are important for future cooking process; store them; create a PDF from these text pieces, arranging the elements on the page according to the templates. Second use case, which is independent from the first one in user&rsquo;s perspective, is generation of recipe recommendations based on typed in ingredients using another ML model. should be created, that will take in the ingredients, turn them into bag of words and compare with stored datasets, gained in the use case 1, choosing the one, that will have highest match of ingredients. In this way data, scraped, cleaned and classified in the UC1 can be used in UC2. More detailed scheme of interactions between UC1, UC2 and system you can find in blog article <a href=https://hexann666.github.io/recipe2pdf.github.io/posts/ds_concept/>Data Science methodology and concept</a>, section Modeling.</p><p>This project planning allowed to evaluate and simulate all activities, that are needed for an ML project, from an idea to a state, that is ready for actual implementation to start. Variaty of topics, that were analyzed, show, that code is just a small part of such project and much effort is needed to make it accesible to a user. It includes not only UI, but also elements of a workflow, that stay invisible for a user, hence contributing to stable work of the software: development environment, storage space, tools and platforms to deploy the ready software state, tools for project organisation to make development transparant and understandable for the team. It would be a mistake to expect, that only a good code can be enough for a good ML application. As long as it only exists in a Jupyter Notebook, however progressive and useful the output is, it can&rsquo;t fully achieve it&rsquo;s goal, as nobody can use it&rsquo;s results. Providing solid stable infrastructure is what really allows to maximize the benefits and learning and practicing this process is a valuable contribution to my education as Data Scientist.</p></div></article></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=site-title-wrapper><h1 class=site-title><a href=https://hexann666.github.io/recipe2pdf.github.io/>Recipe to PDF</a></h1><a class="button-square button-jump-top js-jump-top" href=# aria-label="Back to Top"><i class="fa fa-angle-up" aria-hidden=true></i></a></div><p class=footer-copyright><span>&copy; 2022 / Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a></span></p><p class=footer-copyright><span><a href=https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter>Ghostwriter theme</a> By <a href=http://jollygoodthemes.com>JollyGoodThemes</a></span>
