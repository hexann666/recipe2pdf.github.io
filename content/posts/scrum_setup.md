To structure the tasks in the project I devided all Issues into 7 Steps, 6 of them are provided as required content in the [project requirements](https://lukashuber.notion.site/SE-Portfolio-d319a318fde2409a9fb83f4afee992d8) and Step 0 is dedicated to SCRUM workflow:

**Sprint 0** - prepare canvas for SCRUM

**Sprint 1** - requirements based on the project goal

**Sprint 2** - describe Data Science methodology concept

**Sprint 3** - diagrams

**Sprint 4** - web technologies

**Sprint 5** - architecture (optional)

**Sprint 6** - design and DS architecture

**Sprint 7** - outlook and summary

To follow the Issues assigned to each Step, there is an Epic board, that shows all Issues according to the Epics they belong to.

To track the progress of the Issues there is the Kanban board structured after defined Issue states:
- **open** - automatically given to any new Issue by GitLab if nothing else specified;
- **in progress** - work has begun;
- **blocked** - work is blocked by another not-done Issue;
- **done** - work is finished.

Here Kanban board after finishing Step 0.
